Task Description: Big Data Analysis Using Google Colab

This task focuses on performing Big Data Analysis using Google Colab to demonstrate the concept of scalability and distributed data processing. The objective of the task is to analyze a dataset containing information about 40 students, including their roll number, name, gender, and marks, and to derive meaningful insights using big data tools and techniques.

Google Colab was selected as the execution environment because it provides a cloud-based, scalable, and easy-to-use platform for data analysis without requiring local system configuration. It supports Python libraries such as PySpark, Pandas, and Dask, which are commonly used in big data processing. This makes Google Colab an ideal platform for demonstrating big data concepts in an internship setting.

The dataset used in this task was created in CSV format, which is a widely accepted data format in real-world big data applications. The CSV file was uploaded to Google Colab and loaded into the environment for processing. Initially, the dataset was explored to understand its structure, including the number of records, column names, and data types. This step helped ensure that the dataset was correctly loaded and ready for analysis.

After loading the data, data preprocessing was performed. This included checking for missing values, verifying data consistency, and ensuring that numerical fields such as marks were correctly interpreted. Preprocessing is an essential step in big data analysis, as clean and well-structured data leads to more accurate insights.
